Ansible will pull the artifact from jenkins
Make image and push DockerHub
Ansible will pull image from DockerHub and create container

create EC2
Setup hostname
create ansadmin
Add users to sudoers file
Generate ssh keys
Enable password based login
Install ansible

Create user to add Jenkins so Jenkins can orcastrate the Ansible_Server
After create the ansadmin user add the sudo file > visudo

Means we can execute any command without password
ansadmin ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL 

Enable access with password
vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

service sshd reload

MANAGE DockerHost with Ansible
We will add DockerHost to Ansible as it managel Node.
So that our Ansible control node can able to manage our DockerHost

WE WILL WRITE A PLAYBOOK. THAT PLAYBOOK IS GOING TO TELL TO DockerHost
HOW TO CREATE A container. 
We need to add our DockerHost as a client to slave to Ansible system.

On DockerHost
1) Create ansadmin > useradd ansadmin
2) Add ansadmin to sudoers files > passwd ansadmin
visudo
ansadmin ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL

3) Enable password based login previous task and to see it that
grep Password /etc/ssh/sshd_config


On Ansible_Server
1) Docher host ip Add to hosts file 
2) Copy ssh keys :we copy the  publickey (id_rsa.pub) from ansadmin to the DockerHost 
use the command > ssh-copy-id DockerHost-privateIP
3) Test the connection ansible all -m ping
