we are in the process of setting of the pipelinebto deploy arficats to docker contaner
We will build code and deploy in the tomcat container
To do this

We need to integrate dockerhost to jenkins 
to do this
1) Create a dockeradmin user on docker host and add the docker admin group
2) We would copy artifact from Jenkins to Dockerhost for that we need to use 
"Publish Over SSH" plugin
3) Add Dockerhost to oJenkins "configure systems"

1.1) sudo su -
useradd dockeradmin
passwd dockeradmin
ADD the user dockeradmin ADMIN GROUP
usermod -aG docker dockeradmin

EC2 instances disable for password base auth we should enable it
To Change EC2 auth
vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# To disable tunneled clear text passwords, change to no here!
PasswordAuthentication yes
#PermitEmptyPasswords no
#PasswordAuthentication no

Then Restart
service sshd reload

After Create the dockeradmin we will add plugin to jenkins
Manage Jenkins > Plugin Manager > publish over SSH and install it
this plugin Send build artifacts over SSH
We need to configure docker in the jenkins

Manage Jenkins > configure systems > 

Set admin user  dockeradmin and password and test and save it

WE INTEGRATED dockeradmin TO Jenkins
I CAN ABLE TO auth from Jenkins TO Dockerhost AS A dockeradmin user
i have INTEGRATED my dockerhost with jenkins
