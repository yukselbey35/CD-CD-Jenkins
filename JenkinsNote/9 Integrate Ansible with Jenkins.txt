We need to integrate Ansible with Jenkins
So that Jenkins able to copy artifact to Ansible, 
Ansible can create Image and Deploy to container to dockerhub
publish over SSH

Manage Jenkins > Configure System > publish over SSH
dockerhost already added. we need to add Ansible
add name
add privateIP address as a Hostname
add username: ansadmin

When we done with this we will create new job copy previous job so 
we can edit and use it

Under the Post build-actions
SSH server will be ansible-server
