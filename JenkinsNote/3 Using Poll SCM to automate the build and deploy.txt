Using Poll SCM to automate the build and deploy
We don't want to execute the job manually 
Our purpose is whenever the code deploy or change in the repository
Automatically identify-recognize the change from the github repo and build job and deploy the code
Build Triggers are helpful. 
Under the job BuildAndDeployJob > "Configure"> Build triggers > Poll SCM
Poll SCM does check the github with cron job and if it is change build the job
